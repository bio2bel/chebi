38545	C	CHEBI:38545	ChEBI		rosuvastatin	A dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid that is (6E)-7-{4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-[methyl(methylsulfonyl)amino]-6-(propan-2-yl)pyrimidin-5-yl} hept-6-enoic acid carrying two hydroxy substituents at positions 3 and 5 (the 3R,5S-diastereomer).	2017-02-22	ops$kirill	3
32020	C	CHEBI:32020	KEGG COMPOUND		pitavastatin	A dihydroxy monocarboxylic acid that is (6E)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)quinolin-3-yl]hept-6-enoic acid in which the two hydroxy groups are located at positions 3 and 5 (the 3R,5S-stereoisomer). Used as its calcium salt for treatment of hypercholesterolemia (elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood) on patients unable to sufficiently lower their cholesterol levels by diet and exercise.	2017-02-22	CHEBI	3
38561	C	CHEBI:38561	ChEBI		fluvastatin	A racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (3R,5S)- and (3S,5R)-fluvastatin. An HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, it is used (often as the corresponding sodium salt) to reduce triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol, and increase HDL-chloesterol, in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia.	2017-02-22	ops$kirill	3
87631	C	CHEBI:87631	ChEBI		statin	Any organooxygen compound whose structure is related to compactin (mevastatin) and which may be used as an anticholesteremic drug due its EC 1.1.1.34/EC 1.1.1.88 (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase) inhibitory properties.	2016-01-28	gowen	3
87635	C	CHEBI:87635	ChEBI		statin (synthetic)	A statin which does not occur naturally and which is not obtained by chemical transformation of a naturally occurring statin.	2015-08-24	gowen	3
3558	C	CHEBI:3558	KEGG COMPOUND		cerivastatin	(3R,5S)-3,5-dihydroxyhept-6-enoic acid in which the (7E)-hydrogen is substituted by a 4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2,6-diisopropyl-5-(methoxymethyl)pyridin-3-yl group. Formerly used (as its sodium salt) to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease, it was withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2001 following reports of a severe form of muscle toxicity.	2017-02-22	CHEBI	3
35821	C	CHEBI:35821	ChEBI		anticholesteremic drug	A substance used to lower plasma cholesterol levels.	2016-01-19	ops$mennis	3
